* 2023/07-2023/09: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme
  * Imperial College London
  * Topic: GNN Expressiveness and Graph Generative Models
  * Used PyTorch, PyTDC, and Torchdrug to reproduce and improve current graph representation modules in graph generative models.
  * Implemented new state-of-the-art molecular generation objectives to evaluate the new graph generative models.

* 2022/05-2022/09: Undergraduate Research Opportunities Programme
  * Imperial College London
  * Topic: Explainable AI for Image Segmentation based on COVID-19
  * Used PyTorch, Tensorflow, and MONAI to construct deep learning models to segment images related to healthcare and reproduce explainable modules in relevant papers.
  * Analysed the local and global explainability of different deep learning models, such as U-Net, applied in COVID-19 diagnosis.

* 2022/05-2022/06: Group Research Project
  * Imperial College London
  * Topic: Bayesian Filtering
  * Learnt Bayesian Filtering methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
  * Analysed the numerical results based on the performance of Kalman Filter and Particle Filters in hidden Markov chain with linear Gaussian and non-linear Gaussian noise simulations.
