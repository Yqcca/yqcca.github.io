Hi! I am a MSci student in Mathematics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/). My previous research works focus on AI+, generative models and filtering. My research interests are quite flexible, mainly lying in the fields of generative models, AIGC (2D, 3D), LLM alignment and embodied AI. Currently, I am actively learning and exploring advanced algorithms and models to solve complex data-driven problems in the real world. My goal is to develop explainable deep learning models to better assist people with day-to-day tasks in the era of big data.
