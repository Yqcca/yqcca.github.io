Hi! I am a MSci student in Mathematics at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/). My previous research works focus on AI+healthcare, graph generative models and filtering. My research interests are quite flexible, mainly lying in the fields of machine learning, deep learning and statistics. Currently I am actively learning and exploring advanced algorithms and models to solve complex data-driven problems in the real world. My goal is to develop explainable deep learning models to better assist people with day-to-day tasks in the era of big data.

Outside of academics, I enjoy reading Albert Camus's book, such as _The Myth of Sisyphus_. His works enable me to explore the fundamental question underpinning his philosophy: is life worth living? In addition, I play Go, Bridge and Reach Mahjong.

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../files/cv.pdf)
