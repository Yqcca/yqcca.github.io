Hi! I am a fourth-year Mathematics student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/). My research interests lie in the fields of deep learning and statistics. I am eager to study and explore advanced algorithms and models to solve data-driven problems in the real world.

Outside of academics, I play Go, Bridge and Reach Mahjong.

You can find my CV here: [Curriculum Vitae](../files/github_cv.pdf)
