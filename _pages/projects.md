  * Topic: GNN Expressiveness and Graph Generative Models
  * Used PyTorch, PyTDC, and Torchdrug to reproduce and improve current graph representation modules in graph generative models.
  * Evaluated improved GNN-based graph generative models on the de-novo molecule design task and demonstrated that GNN-based graph generative models with advanced GNNs can achieve state-of-the-art results across many other non-GNN-based graph generative approaches.
  * Concluded expressiveness is not a necessary condition for good GNN-based generative models and goal-directed molecule generation tasks require other abilities of GNNs.

  * Topic: Explainable AI for Image Segmentation based on COVID-19
  * Used PyTorch, Tensorflow, and MONAI to construct deep learning models to segment images related to healthcare and reproduce explainable modules in relevant papers.
  * Analysed the local and global explainability of different deep learning models, such as U-Net, applied in COVID-19 diagnosis.

  * Topic: Bayesian Filtering
  * Learnt Bayesian Filtering methods and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods.
  * Analysed the numerical results based on the performance of Kalman Filter and Particle Filters in hidden Markov chain with linear Gaussian and non-linear Gaussian noise simulations.
